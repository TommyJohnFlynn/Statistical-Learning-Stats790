# Course Description:

Learn new data science methods, focusing on regression (i.e., supervised learning for predictions of continuous outcomes).
• Study the bias-variance trade-off and effective degrees of freedom in statistical prediction; how different methods optimize the bias-variance tradeoff; and how optimization methods are chosen for their computational efficiency and scalability.
• Learn how these methods work and how to implement most of them (i.e., from scratch).
• Practice implementing cross-validation and using it for model selection.
• Gain expertise with programming in R. Develop basic skills in Julia.
